Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the art of applying engineering methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. It's important as it enables the developmet of crucial systems in the digital era in various fields such as communication, entertainment among others.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Development of programming languages. The first high-level programming language was Plankalkul developed between 1942-1945 before the first commercially available programming language-Fortran.
- Introduction of structured/ object-oriented programming in the 1970s. This improved code reusability and modularity.
- Introduction of Agile methodologies in the 2000s which shifted the focus from rigid processes to adaptability and collaboration in development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements; Gathering and identifying project needs and demands.
- Design; Coming up with a detailed structure of the program
- Implementation; Writing and implimenting the code
- Testing; Going through the code and fixing bugs encountered
- Deployment; Release of the product to the target audience
- Maintenance; Updating and refining the program post-deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The watwerfall methodology is sequential and follows a specific pattern hence is majorly applied during the development stage while the Agile methodology has an incremental approach and is quite flexible and is majorly used during maintenance but also plays a good role during development

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software developer; Is responsible for writing code and implementing the solutins of the software within the code.
- Quality Assurance Engineer; Is responsible for ensuring the quality of the product and conducting test plans
- Project Manager; Oversees the whole project from requirements to deployment of the software.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are important as they provide a platform to code, debug and even run code
VCS on the other hand provide a platform to observe changes in the source code and collaborate with others

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines and Changing requirements
This are some of the main challenges faced in Software Engineering. They can be tackled by having a proper plan while prioritizing the important tasks, implimenting agile methodologies and writing clean well documented code.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit testing: Is specific as it tackles specific components or modules of software
- Integration testing: It's important as it checks how various features interact with each other to ensure a seamless operation.
- System testing: It involves testing the whole software hence it's important as it ensures all features implimented work as they should.
- Acceptance testing: It involves going through the requirements to ensure all of them have been well intergrated in the software.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is the process of coming up with effective inputs for AI interactions. It has a number of importances including but not limited to efficiency in AI driven automation, reduction of biasness and misconception or misinformation among others.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: "Give me tips on coding"
Improved prompt: "Provide three best practices for writing clean and efficient java code. Include examples and explanations for each.
